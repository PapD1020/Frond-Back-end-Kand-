    <p>Outer space is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and between celestial bodies.
    Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays.
    The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270.45 °C; −454.81 °F).
    </p>
    <p>
        Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface.
        The Kármán line, an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping.
        The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967.
        This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space.
        Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.
